Welcome to zsm's documentation!
===============================

ZSM is a console program that manages ZFS snapshots.

- Manage multiple sets of rolling snapshots.
- Configure a custom schedule via the config file.
- Run in background by adding it to crontab.

Technically, most of the functionality is in zsm-lib,
and zsm is just a thin console interface.

Project status
--------------

Alpha but works very well and has great test coverage.
